# FOOD HEALTH ESTIMATOR
  This is the final project for class:
  SI206 class (Data-oriented programming)

A software that allows to find out how healthy any food is.

For my project I implemented a software enabling user to look up any foods and get an indepth insights on how healthy foods are.
I developped a normalized "Health Index" for foods that takes into account Macro and Micro nutrients of given food product. 
Index is a number that can be used to evaluate how healthy a food is and compare it with other foods.
